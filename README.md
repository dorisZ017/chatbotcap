# Chatbot project

This repository includes the final presentation of our graduate capstone project. Our task was to design and develop a chatbot that can proactively respond to user's questions when they use the software offered by a local company.

We used Microsoft QnA maker to build the primitive model of the chatbot by feeding in questions and answers that users tend to ask when using the software. Then we collected data of users' questions and then leveraged Natrual Language Processing to analyze data and improve our chatbot.

To help the company improve the user experience of its software, we designed and created dashboard in PowerBI that visualizes users' feedback.
